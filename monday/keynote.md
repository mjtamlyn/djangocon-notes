# Keynote

## [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](http://twitter.com/jacobian)

- keynotes are hard.
- META! A keynote about keynotes.
- Apparently Mr Jobs thinks there's one more thing...
- You could be uber technical. If you've got something that techy to talk
  about.
- Or how about a "state of" (the union?) talk?
- Nah. Let's do a celebration talk! Aren't we bloody awesome.
- Or alternatively say how much things suck. (Constructive) criticism.
- Inspiration! Very american graduation.
- Let's do all of them!

### Technical

Time to first awesome moment is really important. Time for a Moment of WIN!

Providing text documents sucks. Especially to non-techy users. Ok, let's use
sphinx! Hooray it's output pretty and it's all there for free. Danny will even
be live noting that way. Ok, so lets put it online. How to do that? Well try
[static](http://lukearno.com/projects/static/). Auth? Well let's use barrel
(from the same guy). 3 lines of code! One bash command and it's live on heroku.

5 minutes, epic win.

### State of Django

We are strong! Loads of big new cool stuff in each version. Loads of good new
stuff in each version.

1.5? Python 3? Composite key support? Whatever we want?

Github! Lower barrier to entry.

Great software takes 10 years. Just 3 to go then!


### Celebration!

Bloody everyone uses Django. Absolutely everyone. NASA, Google, Instagram,
Intel, Pinterest, Rdio, Disney.........

Boring is good! Exciting is good to play around with something, but it probably
doesn't belong in production. Django is getting boring. Good. We're a safe
choice.

Instagram. $1 BILLION for a django site.

### Criticism

Let's tear us down again.

HTML5. There's something there... The web has levelled up. So many things we
couldn't do not that many years ago. 'Real-time' is also exciting.

It's damn hard to do this in Django atm. Parallel MVC stacks (backbone +
django is hard).

Something that works on Server AND client. Pretty cool. (Meteor). This is the
future. Seamless push and automatic update. Try doing that in any bit it
'boring' software now?

But are we doomed to callback hell?

                    });
                });
            });
        });
    });

Oh god no!

Somehow doesn't impossible though. Django's not that far away from this setup
to start with, is it? (Left as an exercise!)

### Inspiration!

> But if you give it away, how will you make money?

Give it away. Step 2? Profit!?

Hey it worked! Open Source ROCKS. We can give it away and it WORKS.

### Finale

We built something fantastic. 22226 members in the google group! Now we're safe
we can do whatever we want! It's coming...

MAKE GOOD CODE.
